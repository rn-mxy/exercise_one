The task was Algorithmic Thinking and the first in the course Creative Coding. We had to formulate and implement two rules for this sketch - first written or drawn and then as code. We also had to use the sine and cosine to create an animation or interaction.

The rules of my sketch were as follows:

  - Balls should spin as a semicircle in the center of the screen.
  - Generate a random point, which is "flying" free. When it collides with the border, it should bump away.
  - The point is connected with every ball.
  - When the point hits the border, the color of the balls and the point itself should change to a random color from the predefined colorpalette.
